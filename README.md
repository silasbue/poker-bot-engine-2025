other participants.

## Introduction to the rules of poker

The bots will be playing no-limit texas holdem poker.
The detailed rules for this game can be found here:
https://upswingpoker.com/poker-rules/texas-holdem-rules/

### In summary

Each player is dealt 2 private cards face down.

Over the course of the game 5 public community cards are dealt (called board
cards).

To win the player must either get every other player to fold (given up on their
hand) or have the best poker hand at the end of the game.

The poker hand is made up of the 5 best cards out of the 2 private cards the
player is dealt and the 5 board cards shared with all players.

The poker hand rankings are described here:
https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings

The game takes place over 4 betting rounds as described below:

- the 2 players next to the dealer input the small blind and big blind to the
  pot.
- each player is dealt 2 cards
  - PreFlop (betting round 0)
    - players can fold, call, or raise
    - this continues until all players have either folded or called the last
      raise.
    - if 2 or more players have not folded, play continues to the next betting
      round
  - Flop (betting round 1)
    - 3 board cards are dealt
    - if no bet has been made the payers can check (bet nothing)
    - this continues until all players have either folded or called the last
      raise.
    - if 2 or more players have not folded, play continues to the next betting
      round
  - Turn (betting round 2)
    - 1 board cards is dealt to a total of 4
    - play continues as described in the flop section
  - River (betting round 3)
    - 1 board cards is dealt to a total of 5
    - play continues as described in the flop section
    - if 2 or more players have not folded, all players reveal their hands, and
      the best hand wins the pot

### Tournament setup

The bots will play poker in a tournament format, winner takes all.

The tournament will play up to 10 bots against each other until only one of them
has any money left.

During the Tournament the blinds will increase between games at specific
intervals to make sure the tournament ends and discourage passive plays

### Special rules for this tournament

If a bot has less than 1 big blind at the end of a hand they are taken out of
the tournament as if they had no money left.

There is a raise count limitation of 5.
This means that the number of raises in one betting round is limited to 5.

### `example_bots` folder

In this folder there are examples of bots to get inspiration from.

## Bot setup

The main entry point into your bot is the `act` method.

The `act` method is called with an `observation` object and expects an `integer`
in return.

The return integer represents the action your bot is taking:

- 0 = fold
- 1 = call/check
- x > 1 = raise to x :warning:raise to x includes any money you have already put
  into the pot:warning:

The observation object has all the information needed to make a decision.
It has many attributes and helper functions to make coding easier, check them
out in the
[DOCS](https://poker-game-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/poker_game_runner.html)
or in the example bots.

The observation object has an important attribute `legal_actions` that returns a
list of integers, which are legal actions at the current state of the game.

:warning:
Make sure your bot returns a legal action :warning:
if the returned action is not in legal_actions your bot will fold.

:warning:
There is a time limit of 1 second for your bot to return :warning:
if your bot takes longer, your bot will fold.

## Details
